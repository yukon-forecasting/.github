The Yukon River Chinook Operational Run Timing Forecast Project provides managers, harvesters, and other stakeholders with an operational run timing forecast for Yukon River Chinook salmon. Prior to each year's run, we produce a forecast using environmental data and historical catch-per-unit-effort data.
